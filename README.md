This work present methods used to compute meaningful physical properties in aquatic sciences.
Multi-dimensional array (time and depth) are compatible.

Algorithms and documentation are inspired by LakeAnalyzer in R (https://github.com/GLEON/rLakeAnalyzer)

Implemented methods:
    - Thermocline
    - Mixed layer
    - Metalimnion extent (top metalimnion and bottom metalimnion)
    - Wedderburn Number
    - Schmidt stability
    - internal energy
    - Seiche periode
    - Lake Number
    - Brunt-Vaisala frequency
    - Average layer temperature

Future updates:
    Data comparison
    Xarray based for spatial data compatibility
    Smoothing method correction
    Mixed layer interpolation need to be optimized, set as parameter for now
